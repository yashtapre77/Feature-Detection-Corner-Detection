# Feature Detection and Matching â€“ SIFT, RANSAC, and Shi-Tomasi

This project demonstrates three key computer vision algorithms:

- **SIFT**: Detects and matches keypoints between images invariant to scale and rotation.
- **RANSAC**: Removes outlier matches and estimates a reliable transformation (homography).
- **Shi-Tomasi Corner Detection**: Identifies good features (corners) to track in an image.

## How to Run

1. Open each `.ipynb` file in **Jupyter Notebook**, **Google Colab**, or **VS Code with Jupyter Extension**.
2. Run all cells sequentially to see the output.

> **Note**:  
> Ensure the input images are in the **same folder** as the notebook files.  
> If not, **update the image path** in the code accordingly.

## Tools Required

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment

## Example Notebooks

- `SIFT.ipynb`
- `RANSAC.ipynb`
- `Shi_Tomasi.ipynb`
